# Ruby Intensive Postwork

So you've graduated the Flatiron School Ruby track. And you're super tired because you've been working super hard for 12 weeks and you're anxious about your future and trying to learn CS stuff so you can get through technical interviews and it's a lot. We understand. But guess what? This is just the beginning. You have a long and exciting future ahead. It's there for you. You just need to keep on walking this path. Keep on learning. Find your strength. Continue the effort. 

This guide is a collection of resources you should get through in the next 3-6 months. We think it's a great use of your time in between interviews. Instead of freaking out and getting nervous, we think this is a better way to focus your anxieties and energy. 

Be better, it's the best way to get a job and advance. Even when you get a job, you should use your nights and weekends for the next year to go through these things. The path is long, don't sprint, but you must continue putting in effort. Be consistent. Develop this habit. I'm sure you all surprised yourselves with how much you learned in 12 weeks. Trust that it was all you, Flatiron School is just a cog in your machine. Keep going.

This postwork includes review material. We're never too advanced to not learn something from reviewing the fundamentals.

It also includes some advanced concepts about code, Ruby, and Rails.

It even introduces concepts and frameworks we never covered, such as Object Oriented Javascript, frontend frameworks, Node.JS, Javascript testing, and even iOS, Objective-C, and RubyMotion.

Be a unicorn, know it all.

Try to pick a simple domain (maybe [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/)) so that as you learn new languages and frameworks, you can implement that same problem over and over again.

# Other Things to Do Besides Learning

Finally this document suggests other things that you can do to increase your value.

## Blog

Start writing serious blog posts. Use SEO, write good titles, keep the articles professional (so less personal narratives, just informative content). Use clean code examples. Format things correctly. And then start promoting the blog posts. Send them to elana@flatironschool.com and stephanie@flatironschool.com so we can promote them to our networks. Ping [Peter Cooper](http://twitter.com/peterc) of [RubyWeekly](http://rubyweekly.com/) and his other 50 newsletters. We could even start a Newsletter for the 3,000 people in NYC on Rails. You can also contact bloggers like [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/), and [Treehouse Blog](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/) and [Hakka Labs](http://www.hakkalabs.co/), [Huff Po Code](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huffpost-code/) and 100s of others (let's start compiling a list of blogs that take guests posts and developer relationships with those authors). Make it a goal of yours to get a post in RubyWeekly or on a Guest Blog. Be brave.

# Web Development

There are many mediums, through which one can deliver applications. You can
have Desktop Applications, [Embedded Applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) and Web Applications to name a
few. At Flatiron School we focus on building Web Applications.

In a previous section you built a static website using HTML and CSS. You used
markup languages to tell the browser how to render the content you were
displaying. In order to have the ability to interact with your users and store
the information they give you, we'll need to add more technologies to our
toolbelt. These technologies are usually referred to as your "Stack."

A stack usually includes the following:

  * Operating System: a collection of software that manages computer hardware
    resources and provides common services for computer programs e.g. [Linux](http://www.linux.org/)
  * Web Server: Software that helps deliver web content to a client e.g.
    [nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main)
  * Database: An organized collection of data. [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) for example.
  * Programming Language, like [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
  * A Web Framework like [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/)

We've already covered the basics of your operating system and done a brief
intro to Ruby. Now we will do a short intro to the language that is used by
most of the databases we will be using, SQL.

# About

## Credits

First, we'd love to thank all the amazing people who created these source
materials. Most of it is from CodeSchool and Treehouse, with a bit from Zed
Shaw, and some from the people at Skillcrush. Obviously there are a lot more
resources out there for learning these topics. This guide is just my current
preferences and tries to put them in a linear fashion so skills can build upon
each other. Hope it helps someone. Oh and the theme for the site was purchased
from [WrapBootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).
