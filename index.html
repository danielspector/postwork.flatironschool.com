            <h1>Ruby Intensive Postwork</h1>

<p>So you&#39;ve graduated the Flatiron School Ruby track. And you&#39;re super tired because you&#39;ve been working super hard for 12 weeks and you&#39;re anxious about your future and trying to learn CS stuff so you can get through technical interviews and it&#39;s a lot. We understand. But guess what? This is just the beginning. You have a long and exciting future ahead. It&#39;s there for you. You just need to keep on walking this path. Keep on learning. Find your strength. Continue the effort. </p>

<p>This guide is a collection of resources you should get through in the next 3-6 months. We think it&#39;s a great use of your time in between interviews. Instead of freaking out and getting nervous, we think this is a better way to focus your anxieties and energy. </p>

<p>Be better, it&#39;s the best way to get a job and advance. Even when you get a job, you should use your nights and weekends for the next year to go through these things. The path is long, don&#39;t sprint, but you must continue putting in effort. Be consistent. Develop this habit. I&#39;m sure you all surprised yourselves with how much you learned in 12 weeks. Trust that it was all you, Flatiron School is just a cog in your machine. Keep going.</p>

<p>This postwork includes review material. We&#39;re never too advanced to not learn something from reviewing the fundamentals.</p>

<p>It also includes some advanced concepts about code, Ruby, and Rails.</p>

<p>It even introduces concepts and frameworks we never covered, such as Object Oriented Javascript, frontend frameworks, Node.JS, Javascript testing, and even iOS, Objective-C, and RubyMotion.</p>

<p>Be a unicorn, know it all.</p>

<p>Try to pick a simple domain (maybe <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a>) so that as you learn new languages and frameworks, you can implement that same problem over and over again.</p>

<h2>Other Things to Do Besides Learning</h2>

<p>Finally this document suggests other things that you can do to increase your value.</p>

<h3>Blog</h3>

<p>Start writing serious blog posts. Use SEO, write good titles, keep the articles professional (so less personal narratives, just informative content). Use clean code examples. Format things correctly. And then start promoting the blog posts. Send them to elana@flatironschool.com and stephanie@flatironschool.com so we can promote them to our networks. Ping <a href="http://twitter.com/peterc">Peter Cooper</a> of <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">RubyWeekly</a> and his other 50 newsletters. We could even start a Newsletter for the 3,000 people in NYC on Rails. You can also contact bloggers like <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>, and <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse Blog</a> and <a href="http://www.hakkalabs.co/">Hakka Labs</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huffpost-code/">Huff Po Code</a> and 100s of others (let&#39;s start compiling a list of blogs that take guests posts and developer relationships with those authors). Make it a goal of yours to get a post in RubyWeekly or on a Guest Blog. Be brave.</p>

<h2>The Command Line</h2>

<p><em>Min 2hr Max 6hr</em></p>

<p>The command line is your home base. It&#39;s probably one of the most important
differences between a consumer of a computer, and a user. Many developers have
all sorts of crazy short cut keys set up so that they can use their computer
solely from the command line without ever having to reach for the mouse. It&#39;s
vitaly important that you start thinking like a developer, rather than a
consumer. Getting comfortable with the command line is the first step. If you
feel like you&#39;re spending too much time on this section, and you&#39;ve
accomplished the learning objectives, move on.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Navigate a file structure</li>
<li>Use your terminal to type commands</li>
<li>Make files and directories from the command line</li>
<li>Open files from the command line</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations-2" title="Console Foundation Treehouse Link">Console Foundations</a> is a great video series by Treehouse that
covers lots of Bash Stuff. Some of it is more advanced, so we only included a
few sections we feel are crucial. But feel free to skip around. The stuff about
Environment Variables and PATHS is important. But it&#39;s short and worth going
through at least once.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3>Some Bonus Material</h3>

<p>The following are great resources, they just are a bit advanced and longer. We
highly recommend you putting in the time to read and go through these examples,
but don&#39;t worry if they are confusing. Do your best, always.</p>

<p>What is version control?!</p>

<p>Github&#39;s &quot;About Version Control&quot; Version control is a system that records
changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific
versions later. Even though the examples in this book show software source code
as the files under version control, in reality any type of file on a computer
can be placed under version control.</p>

<h1>Programming</h1>

<h2>Ruby</h2>

<p><em>Min 20Hr Max 40Hr</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>My conscience won’t let me call Ruby a computer language. That would imply
that the language works primarily on the computer’s terms. That the language
is designed to accomodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore,
we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computer’s
locale. It’s the computer’s language and we are translators for the world.</p>

<p>But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that
language? When you start to use the language’s own words and colloquialisms
to express yourself. Say, the computer can’t do that. How can it be the
computer’s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!</p>

<p>We can no longer truthfully call it a computer language. It is coderspeak.
It is the language of our thoughts.</p>

<p><a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">_why&#39;s poignant guide to ruby</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Programming allows you to automate common, repetitive tasks on the computer.
Developers use programming languages to write software, the software you
interact with every day. From your alarm clock to your computer; from the web to
the satellites orbiting our planet, software powers all of it.</p>

<p>Ruby is a programming language that we can use to do any task that needs to be
automated. For example, something that is really irritating is a cluttered
&quot;Downloads&quot; folder on your Mac. We could write a program that moves a file to a
new folder, based on it&#39;s file extension, whenever we download something. A
&quot;scripting-language&quot; would be best suited for this task.</p>

<p>Ruby is one of the most popular languages to create web applications. A web
framework is a tool that makes developing for the web relatively simple. The
most popular web frameworks for Ruby are Sinatra and Ruby on Rails. All of
these languages and web frameworks are considered server side languages as they
will be run on an actual web server.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Basic Ruby syntax</li>
<li>Defining a method</li>
<li>Looping and iteration</li>

<p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby">http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby</a></p>

<p>We think the CodeAcademy Ruby Track is a comprehensive and engaging way to
cover the fundementals of the Ruby Langauge. Do it all. The super super
important parts are:</p>

<p>The Treehouse Ruby series is a great beginner resource. It&#39;s a bit slower
paced, so feel free to move faster if you got through the CodeAcademy unit
easily.</p>

<p>Chris Pine&#39;s Learn to Program is a classic book that is mostly available online
for free. Read it all. Then buy it and read it again. By the point in the 
  prework, the fundementals of Ruby should be pretty clear. Pine&#39;s book is also

<p><a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits">http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits</a></p>

<p>Learn all the little bits that make Ruby one of the most popular programming
languages amongst non-programmers and programmers alike.</p>

<h1>Web Development</h1>

<p>There are many mediums, through which one can deliver applications. You can
have Desktop Applications, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system">Embedded Applications</a> and Web Applications to name a
few. At Flatiron School we focus on building Web Applications.</p>

<p>In a previous section you built a static website using HTML and CSS. You used
markup languages to tell the browser how to render the content you were
displaying. In order to have the ability to interact with your users and store
the information they give you, we&#39;ll need to add more technologies to our
toolbelt. These technologies are usually referred to as your &quot;Stack.&quot;</p>

<p>A stack usually includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operating System: a collection of software that manages computer hardware
resources and provides common services for computer programs e.g. <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a></li>
<li>Web Server: Software that helps deliver web content to a client e.g.
<a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx</a></li>
<li>Database: An organized collection of data. <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for example.</li>
<li>Programming Language, like <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a></li>
<li>A Web Framework like <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ve already covered the basics of your operating system and done a brief
intro to Ruby. Now we will do a short intro to the language that is used by
most of the databases we will be using, SQL.</p>

<h2>SQL &amp; Databases</h2>

<p><em>Min 4hr Max 10hr</em></p>

<p>In order for a web application to be useful it needs to store data, access that
data and organize the data. This is the job of a database. Typically web apps
respond to user input and do one of four things, create, read, update, or
delete data in a database. Ruby serves as a kind of intermediary between the
user and the database and Ruby can communicate with a database in its native
language, which for our purposes is SQL.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Understand what a database is used for</li>
<li>Be able to create, read, update and delete data</li>
<li>Understand how you can relate two tables in a database (ex. products and categories)</li>
<li>Be able to write a simple SQL join between two tables</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations">Treehouse SQL Course</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations">http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations</a></p>

<p>The Treehouse SQL course is comprehensive and easy to follow. It uses MySQL,
which is a powerful database server that we don&#39;t really use at Flatiron for
teaching purposes, but learning how to install it and use its GUI isn&#39;t a waste
of time. So feel free to gloss over the MySQL setup / specific stuff, but it&#39;s
useful.</p>

<h3><a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/">ZetCode SQL Course</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/">http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/</a></p>

<p>A more technical introduction to SQL through SQLite3 and the Terminal. It&#39;s
short and intense, but try to get through the entire thing. A nice bonus is if
you want to start playing with SQLite and Ruby, go through the other <a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqliteruby/">Zetcode
SQLite and Ruby</a> tutorial.</p>

<h2>Rails</h2>

<p><em>Min 8hr Max 16hr</em></p>

<p>To build a Rails application you&#39;ll need to be able to save and retrieve data
from a database using SQL, send HTML and CSS back to the browser, navigate your
computer using the command line, and use git to version control your source
code. Because Rails requires so many skills at once, we don&#39;t want the focus of
the prework to be Rails, but rather getting introduced to the concepts
necessary to build modern web applications. Hopefully the first time we talk
about Rails in the classroom, it won&#39;t be the first time you&#39;ve heard the terms
controller or route, but it&#39;s also not the goal to master Rails before you get
here. With that in mind, feel free to spend as much time as you&#39;d like
exploring Rails through the following tutorials. However, we&#39;re going to cover
all of this in depth during the semester so it&#39;s probably best to use these
turorials as a guide for the component skills you&#39;ll need to build web
applications. For example, how much Ruby do I need to know? Can be answered by
building a Rails application and seeing how much Ruby you need to know.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Understand how to create a basic data model</li>
<li>Posting data from a web form to create new objects in the database</li>
<li>Controllers</li>
<li>Routes and URLs</li>
<li>The Params Object</li>
<li>Gathering data from a database, sending the data from the controller to the view</li>
</ol>
