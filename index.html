            <h1>Ruby Intensive Postwork</h1>

<p>So you&#39;ve graduated the Flatiron School Ruby track. And you&#39;re super tired because you&#39;ve been working super hard for 12 weeks and you&#39;re anxious about your future and trying to learn CS stuff so you can get through technical interviews and it&#39;s a lot. We understand. But guess what? This is just the beginning. You have a long and exciting future ahead. It&#39;s there for you. You just need to keep on walking this path. Keep on learning. Find your strength. Continue the effort. </p>

<p>This guide is a collection of resources you should get through in the next 3-6 months. We think it&#39;s a great use of your time in between interviews. Instead of freaking out and getting nervous, we think this is a better way to focus your anxieties and energy. </p>

<p>Be better, it&#39;s the best way to get a job and advance. Even when you get a job, you should use your nights and weekends for the next year to go through these things. The path is long, don&#39;t sprint, but you must continue putting in effort. Be consistent. Develop this habit. I&#39;m sure you all surprised yourselves with how much you learned in 12 weeks. Trust that it was all you, Flatiron School is just a cog in your machine. Keep going.</p>

<p>This postwork includes review material. We&#39;re never too advanced to not learn something from reviewing the fundamentals.</p>

<p>It also includes some advanced concepts about code, Ruby, and Rails.</p>

<p>It even introduces concepts and frameworks we never covered, such as Object Oriented Javascript, frontend frameworks, Node.JS, Javascript testing, and even iOS, Objective-C, and RubyMotion.</p>

<p>Be a unicorn, know it all.</p>

<p>Try to pick a simple domain (maybe <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a>) so that as you learn new languages and frameworks, you can implement that same problem over and over again.</p>

<h1>Other Things to Do Besides Learning</h1>

<p>Finally this document suggests other things that you can do to increase your value.</p>

<h2>Blog</h2>

<p>Start writing serious blog posts. Use SEO, write good titles, keep the articles professional (so less personal narratives, just informative content). Use clean code examples. Format things correctly. And then start promoting the blog posts. Send them to elana@flatironschool.com and stephanie@flatironschool.com so we can promote them to our networks. Ping <a href="http://twitter.com/peterc">Peter Cooper</a> of <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">RubyWeekly</a> and his other 50 newsletters. We could even start a Newsletter for the 3,000 people in NYC on Rails. You can also contact bloggers like <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>, and <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse Blog</a> and <a href="http://www.hakkalabs.co/">Hakka Labs</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huffpost-code/">Huff Po Code</a> and 100s of others (let&#39;s start compiling a list of blogs that take guests posts and developer relationships with those authors). Make it a goal of yours to get a post in RubyWeekly or on a Guest Blog. Be brave.</p>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to describe the visual look of
a web page. Using CSS, it is possible to change colors, margin, padding, fonts,
and much more.</p>

<p>CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets 3) is a superset of CSS that adds many new
constructs and properties. Support for CSS3 is rapidly improving across all
major browsers, making it a critical piece of technology for modern web
professionals.</p>

<h1>Programming</h1>

<p>Included file general/ruby.md not found in _includes directory</p>

<h1>Web Development</h1>

<p>There are many mediums, through which one can deliver applications. You can
have Desktop Applications, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system">Embedded Applications</a> and Web Applications to name a
few. At Flatiron School we focus on building Web Applications.</p>

<p>In a previous section you built a static website using HTML and CSS. You used
markup languages to tell the browser how to render the content you were
displaying. In order to have the ability to interact with your users and store
the information they give you, we&#39;ll need to add more technologies to our
toolbelt. These technologies are usually referred to as your &quot;Stack.&quot;</p>

<p>A stack usually includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operating System: a collection of software that manages computer hardware
resources and provides common services for computer programs e.g. <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a></li>
<li>Web Server: Software that helps deliver web content to a client e.g.
<a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx</a></li>
<li>Database: An organized collection of data. <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for example.</li>
<li>Programming Language, like <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a></li>
<li>A Web Framework like <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ve already covered the basics of your operating system and done a brief
intro to Ruby. Now we will do a short intro to the language that is used by
most of the databases we will be using, SQL.</p>

<p>Included file general/sql<em>and</em>databases.md not found in _includes directory</p>

<h2>Rails</h2>

<p><em>Min 8hr Max 16hr</em></p>

<p>To build a Rails application you&#39;ll need to be able to save and retrieve data
from a database using SQL, send HTML and CSS back to the browser, navigate your
computer using the command line, and use git to version control your source
code. Because Rails requires so many skills at once, we don&#39;t want the focus of
the prework to be Rails, but rather getting introduced to the concepts
necessary to build modern web applications. Hopefully the first time we talk
about Rails in the classroom, it won&#39;t be the first time you&#39;ve heard the terms
controller or route, but it&#39;s also not the goal to master Rails before you get
here. With that in mind, feel free to spend as much time as you&#39;d like
exploring Rails through the following tutorials. However, we&#39;re going to cover
all of this in depth during the semester so it&#39;s probably best to use these
turorials as a guide for the component skills you&#39;ll need to build web
applications. For example, how much Ruby do I need to know? Can be answered by
building a Rails application and seeing how much Ruby you need to know.</p>
