## RubyMotion

RubyMotion is a toolchain that lets you develop (and test!) native iOS and OS X applications using Ruby. You'll still need to really understand the iOS SDK (and, it's definitely recommended to learn Objective-C first, even though RubyMotion lets you code in Ruby), but it's nice to be able to write iOS applications in the language we all know and love.

Once you buy a [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) license, dive into the following resources:

### [RubyMotion Getting Started](http://www.rubymotion.com/developer-center/guides/getting-started/)

This is a nice, short guide that will get you up and running with RubyMotion quickly with the classic 'Hello World' application.

### [RubyMotion NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/29-rubymotion)

Take a deeper dive with the NSScreencast on RubyMotion. It's a good one.

### [Pragmatic Programmer Ruby Motion Video](http://pragmaticstudio.com/screencasts/rubymotion)

This is a great, 50-minute screencast that teaches you how to create a basic iOS app using RubyMotion. It does assume you are familiar with the iOS SDK, however, so keep that in mind.

### [The Pragmatic Programmer: RubyMotion](http://pragprog.com/book/carubym/rubymotion)

From the book's description:

>Make beautiful apps with beautiful code: use the elegant and concise Ruby programming language with RubyMotion to write truly native iOS apps with less code while having more fun. You'll learn the essentials of creating great apps, and by the end of this book, you'll have built a fully functional API-driven app. Whether you're a newcomer looking for an alternative to Objective-C or a hardened Rails veteran, RubyMotion allows you to create gorgeous apps with no compromise in performance or developer happiness.
