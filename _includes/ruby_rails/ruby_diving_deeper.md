### Diving Deeper

The deeper you get into Ruby, the more you'll fall in love with the language. It's simplicity and clarity on the surface make it approachable and fun, but the more advanced features of the language make it a joy to work with as an experienced developer.

Take some time to really explore Ruby.

First, dive into Ruby 2.0. Sure, it's not the newest version any more, but you can learn a ton about the language by looking at what has changed from earlier versions. The jump from 1.9 to 2.0 was a big one.

Next, go through the Code School Ruby Bits courses. They dive into some stuff you may not currently use all the time, but you'll end up understanding some really cool (and more advanced) stuff.

Love Project Euler, but which it had a slicker interface, and was more language-specific? Join [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=ruby) to test your knowledge of Ruby (and other languages!) and sharpen your skills.
