## Hackathons

One of the best things you can do to increase your value in the tech world is to meet as many people as possible and let as many of them as possible see what a great developer you are. There's really no better bang for your buck in this regard than participating in hackathons.

They're also really fun, which is a nice bonus. And they are great places to play around with new technologies and get better at writing code quickly.
