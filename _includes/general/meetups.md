## Meetups

Want to meet more developers in your area? Get more experience presenting? There's a meetup or twenty for you!

Attending meetups is a great way to get involved in the Ruby and larger developer communities. It's also a great way to check out new technologies you're interested in.

Need some practice presenting? Want to polish up an idea before submitting to a CFP for conferences? Meetups are great places to present. There are so many out there that they are always looking for people to talk. You'll be a shoo-in.
