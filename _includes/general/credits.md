## Credits

First, we'd love to thank all the amazing people who created these source
materials. Most of it is from CodeSchool and Treehouse, with a bit from Zed
Shaw, and some from the people at Skillcrush. Obviously there are a lot more
resources out there for learning these topics. This guide is just my current
preferences and tries to put them in a linear fashion so skills can build upon
each other. Hope it helps someone. Oh and the theme for the site was purchased
from [WrapBootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).
