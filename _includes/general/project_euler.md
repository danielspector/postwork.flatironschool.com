## Project Euler

Programming, as you know, is all about problem solving and understanding different domains. The language you work in doesn't matter (though, come on, Ruby is obviously the best).

Practice approaching problems with a programmer's mindset by working your way through the Project Euler problems. Doing this is also a great way to sharpen up your skills with the more "computer science-y" side of code.
